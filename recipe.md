Measure the ingredients: AP flour, Cadbury Cocoa Powder, baking soda, baking powder, caster sugar, salt and oil.
Sift all the dry ingredients in one bowl and set aside.
Grease and line an 8 inch round pan with parchment paper. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C
Measure the wet ingredients: buttermilk, coffee water (or water), egg, oil and vanilla extract.

Add these wet ingredients to another bowl. Mix thoroughly
Add the wet mixture to the dry and whisk till they're well combined.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in it comes out clean.

Allow the cake to cool for 5-10 minutes before taking it out of the pan. Then cool on a wire rack. Once it has cooled down completely, crumble it.

Measure the ingredients for the filling: Cadbury Red Velvet Silk, Cadbury Cooking Block Dark, whipped cream, crumbled cake.
Add the whipped cream to the crumbled cake. Mix well until the cake and cream are completely merged.
Melt the Cadbury Cooking Block Dark.

Take a cakesicle mould and pour the melted Cadbury Cooking Block Dark over it. Swirl it around till the chocolate covers all the edges and corners.

Push the ice cream stick in the mould opening. Do this for all the cakesicle cavities. Fill the mould with the crumbled cake filling and press it down.
Pour more melted chocolate to seal the Cakesicles. Put the cakesicle mould in the fridge for 10 minutes for the chocolate to set.
Carefully demould the Cakesicles. Drip the melted chocolate on the Cakesicles and sprinkle Cadbury Red Velvet Silk on top. Done!
